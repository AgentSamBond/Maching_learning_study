# Introduction

Hello there!

I'm Aleksei, I began my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Bonn in Winter Semester 2022-2023. 

Here I am collecting all the material that me and my peers have generated during the studies. Course related programming assignments, written tasks and lecture notes are organized in respective folders.

# Table of contents

| Name | Description | Semester | Status | Collaborators |
| :---- |:----| :---:|:---:|:---:|
| **[Computer Vision<br />I](https://github.com/AgentSamBond/Maching_learning_study/tree/main/2201_Computer_vision)** | The class covers a number of mathematical methods and their applications in computer vision. For example, linear filters, edges, Hough transform, segmentation, active contours, background subtraction, temporal filtering, active appearance models, cameras, 2d/3d features, 3d pose estimation, articulated pose estimation, RGBD vision. | WiSe<br />22-23 | Ongoing | 50/50 with Svetlana Seliunina |
| **[Technical Neural Networks](https://github.com/AgentSamBond/Maching_learning_study/tree/main/4204_Technical_Neural_Networks)** | 	The lecture gives an overview over the most important technical neural networks and neural paradigms. The following topics are explained in detail: Perceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Networks, Back-Propagation of Error, Reinforcement Learning, Q-learning, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Learning. | WiSe<br />22-23 | Ongoing | 50/50 with Svetlana Seliunina |
| **[Graph Representation Learning](https://github.com/AgentSamBond/Maching_learning_study/tree/main/4316_Graph_Representation_Learning)**| We will discuss general approaches for machine learning on graph structured data. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs), graph kernels, as well as graph mining techniques. In the area of graph mining, we will investigate fast (approximate) algorithms to count small patterns, such as triangles, or trees. |WiSe<br />22-23 | Ongoing | 100% me |
